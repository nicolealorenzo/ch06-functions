## Exercise 1: writing and executing functions

## Write a function `AddThree` that adds 3 to an input value
AddThree <- function(x){
  z <- x+3
  return(z)
}

## Create a variable `ten` by passing 7 to your `AddThree` function
ten <- AddThree(7)

## Write a function `FeetToMeters` that converts from feet to meters
## 
## Note: if you come with metric background, you may want to do the following three questions
## in the opposite way: create function 'metersToFeet' and compute you height in feet below


## Create a variable `height.in.feet` that is your height in feet


## Create a variable `height.in.meters` by passing `height.in.feet` to your `FeetToMeters` function

## ------------------------------ challenge ------------------------------
## create a function that converts height from meters to feet and inches
